# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## What is an ADR?

An **Architectural Decision Record (ADR)** is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs provide a concise and structured way to record the thought process behind significant technical decisions, ensuring that the rationale is preserved for current and future team members.

Each ADR follows a specific template to maintain consistency and clarity. In this repository, we use Michael Nygard's ADR template, which is widely recognized for its simplicity and effectiveness.

## How to generate the ADR quickly

After you have done research, provide the idea to AI LLM. Ask it to generate ADR with Michael Nygard template.

ADRs have use in AI use. The more AI has information, more accurate the provided answers are.

## Benefits of Using ADRs

1. **Historical Context:** ADRs provide a documented history of why specific technical decisions were made, aiding future troubleshooting and decision-making.
2. **Knowledge Sharing:** They help onboard new team members by offering insights into the application's architecture and decision-making rationale.
3. **Transparency:** ADRs promote clear communication and transparency within the team.
4. **Change Management:** They help track and manage changes to architectural decisions over time.
5. **Avoid Redundant Discussions:** By documenting past decisions, the team can avoid revisiting the same discussions repeatedly.

## Best Practices for ADRs

1. **One Decision Per ADR:** Each ADR should focus on a single architectural decision to maintain clarity.
2. **Immutable Records:** Old ADRs are never modified. If a decision is changed, a new ADR is created to document the new decision, and the previous one is marked as "superseded."
3. **Sequential Numbering:** Use sequential numbers for ADRs to provide an easy reference (e.g., `0001`, `0002`).
4. **Descriptive Names:** After the number, include a clear and concise name for the ADR (e.g., `0001_use_mysql_as_database.md`).
5. **Collaborative Review:** Encourage team discussions and reviews before finalizing an ADR.
6. **Keep It Short and Clear:** Avoid unnecessary details; focus on the decision, context, and consequences.

## ADR File Naming Convention

We follow a strict naming convention to ensure all ADRs are easily identifiable and organized:

- Format: `[number]_[decision_name].md`
- Example: `0001_use_mysql_as_database.md`

## Directory Structure

All ADRs are stored in the `docs/adrs` directory of this repository. The directory structure looks like this:

```
/docs/adrs/
  ├── index.md
  ├── 0001_use_mysql_as_database.md
  ├── 0002_switch_to_postgresql.md
  └── ...
```

## How to Write an ADR

Follow these steps to create a new ADR:

1. Navigate to the `docs/adrs` directory.
2. Create a new file with the next sequential number and a descriptive name (e.g., `0003_adopt_kubernetes.md`).
3. Use the following template for the content:

   ```markdown
   # [Title of Decision]

   ## Status

   [Proposed | Accepted | Superseded]

   ## Context

   [Describe the issue that prompted this decision. Include relevant background information.]

   ## Decision

   [State the decision that was made and why it was chosen.]

   ## Consequences

   [Describe the positive and negative effects of this decision.]
   ```

4. Commit the new ADR to the repository with a meaningful commit message.

## Superseding Old ADRs

When a new ADR replaces a previous one, mark the old ADR as "Superseded" in the **Status** section and link to the new ADR. For example:

```markdown
## Status

Superseded by [0002_switch_to_postgresql.md]
```

This ensures that the decision history is preserved without modifying the original record.

## Summary

ADRs are an essential tool for documenting architectural decisions in a clear, structured, and transparent manner. By following the practices outlined here, we can ensure that our technical decision-making is well-documented and easily understood by all team members, both current and future.
